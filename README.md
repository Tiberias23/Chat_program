- documentation

I know that this is a lot of features that are missing but this project is just a simple chat program that 
I made to learn more about networking and python, and it's in early Development.
(that's also why this readme is so bad, and it doesn't have a license) (and this is something like a todo list)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Chat_program.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Chat_program
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
2. Start the client:
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

if you need a Gui version of the client you can use the client_gui.py file instead of the client.py file in the other branch.

if you want to run the client on a different machine you need to change the host variable in the client.py file to the ip address of the server machine be for running it.

if you want to make your own client you have to encode end decode your Message with Base64

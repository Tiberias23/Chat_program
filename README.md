# Chat Program

## Overview

This project is a simple chat program that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. It uses Python and various libraries to implement the functionality but most of it is with the socked library.

## Features

- Real-time chat
- Private messages
- Group chat
- Message encoding with Base64

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Chat_program.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Chat_program
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
2. Start the client:
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

if you need a Gui version of the client you can use the client_gui.py file instead of the client.py file in the other branch.

if you want to run the client on a different machine you need to change the host variable in the client.py file to the ip address of the server machine bevor running it.
